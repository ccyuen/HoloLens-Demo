2. Build the project (Follow the HoloTutorials to setup a Unity build specific to the HoloLens)
3. Open the solution file that you just built from Unity in VS and for the solution configurations select Release, x86 and the HoloLens emulator (or select device for USB connection to the HoloLens or remote device for wifi connection to the HoloLens)
4. Run without debugging
